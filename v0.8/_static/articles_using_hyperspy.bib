	abstract = {Fully energy-filtered X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy is used to analyze the spatial distribution of the silicon sub-oxide structure at the {SiO2/Si} interface as a function of underlying doping pattern. Using a spectroscopic pixel-by-pixel curve fitting analysis, we obtain the sub-oxide binding energy and intensity distributions over the full field of view. Binding energy maps for each oxidation state are obtained with a spatial resolution of 120 nm. Within the framework of a five-layer model, the experimental data are used to obtain quantitative maps of the sub-oxide layer thickness and also their spatial distribution over the p-n junctions. Variations in the sub-oxide thicknesses are found to be linked to the level and type of doping. The procedure, which takes into account instrumental artefacts, enables the quantitative analysis of the full {3D} dataset.},

	abstract = {We study materials that present challenges for conventional elemental mapping techniques and can in some cases be treated successfully using independent component analysis {(ICA).} In this case the material in question is obtained from a {TiO2-SiO2} solid solution that is spinodally decomposed into {TiO2} {rich-SnO2} rich multilayers. Conventional elemental mapping is difficult because the edges most easily mapped for these elements {(Ti-L}, {Sn-M} and {O-K)} all have onsets within the same 80 {eV} range. {ICA} is used to separate entire spectral signals corresponding to particular material phases or molecular units rather than particular elements and is thus able to distinguish between {TiO2} and {SnO2.} We show that quantification of oxide species can be performed by different methods that require extra assumptions, but nevertheless should be feasible in many cases.},
